# secure-composer
Secure Composer was a project I did while pursuing an MSc in Music Technology at the University of Limerick. It is a tool for sending encrypted messages and for composing. It creates music from your encrypted text. You send that audio file to someone, the receiver decode the audio file to get the decrypted text.
